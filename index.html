            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is an easier and better way to go back to a specific version. It allows the designer to make changes but if they do not like something or just want to compare it they can go back to a previous version. It is also very useful in a group of designers because they can go back and look who and when did a particular thing. It is an amazing recovery method just in case you lose and mess something up, you always have a file to go back to and recover. Using a version control or VCS is very popular and much needed to be the most efficient and useful designer. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A repository to control history is a very neat development. This allows the developer to record a change to their history and to track their status and version. It allows them to keep track of their projects or files through everything they have ever done. This will allow you to undo mistakes quickly and easily. The designer can browse through their projects and view all the changes that have ever been made. It also would allow the designer to push and pull from their remote repositories. Creating a repository can be done by taking a local directory and turning it into a Git repository, or clone an existing repository. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Remote Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">For two of my topics I will be discussing Remote and Local repository. A remote repository resides on a remote server and is shared among multiple members of a team. It helps for a common single repository that all developers can have access to. This will allow all team members to view all files and projects so as a group they can work and edit them. This can be extremely productive meaning any developer can update your files, so they are properly stored. The changes will be made locally and then uploaded to the remote repository.  It helps for members to share and exchange together.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Local Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A local repository is just stored on one person's computer and only accessible by that one person. Local repository controls most of the work that happens in a project. If you are a single person and working on your own project, then there is not a need for a remote repository which I talked about earlier. Every user will have his/her own local repository and it is all theirs. This is what I assume I will be using in my Web Applications course and after I am done using my local repository then it can be uploaded to a remote one.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a distributed version control system. Git is an extremely convenient and simple system. It is designed to handle everything no matter the size, so it can be the biggest project or the smallest it does not matter. One of the best features of Git is that every user has a complete copy of the repository data. The best feature for a person like me in a Web Applications course is everything is local, so I can work offline whenever and wherever. Git is also lightning fast performance, so you never have to worry about slow performance. It is everything that a professional and a student could want.</p>
